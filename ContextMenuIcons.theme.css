    Selectors for event menu actions depend on your client's language.
    You can hide the event menu icons by selecting 'no' if your client
    isn't set to english as the theme currently doesn't support other
    languages.

  /*
    Selectors in the BetterSettings also depend on you client's language.
    Icons were set in a specific order and will only work properly if you
    set your Vencord options at the bottom. If you do not want to, you can
    set the property to hide the icons.

    Alternatively, you can copy the css rules in the source code by
    searching for '@container root style(--bettersettingsicons: show)'
    and adjust them individually in your quick css to reorder the icons.
